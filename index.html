          While we're designed for people who build, maintain, and care about the world around them regardless of your job. There's so much networking right now. Tech events care about building, scaling, "the next big thing" and not so much "that big thing we built yesterday that everyone is neglecting." That's where we come in. And maybe that's you, too.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
          Perhaps you have questions, maybe some answers. It won't be all talk and no play. The food will be good and maybe you'll make a friend. The vibes will be good.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text strong">
          Build with us.
